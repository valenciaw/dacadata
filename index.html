				<h1>Undocumented Immigrants</h1>
				<h2> The Cost of DACA</h2>
			
				<br>
				<p> I read an article called <a href="https://youthradio.org/journalism/i-just-got-daca-and-now-trump-might-cancel-it/"> I Just Got DACA, And Now Trump Is Canceling It</a>. In this I learned that it costs $480, this suprised me because if the person applying can't get a job legally without DACA why are they charging such a great ammount? After doing more research I found out that DACA can be a great financial burden on a family. <a href="https://media.wix.com/ugd/bfd9f2_4ac79f01ab9f4247b580aeb3afd3da95.pdf"> One survey</a> found that 40% of respondants say they know someone who is eligible for DACA but hasn't applied because they can't afford the fee. </p>
